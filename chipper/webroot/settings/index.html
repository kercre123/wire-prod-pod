    <h1>Wire-Pod Installation</h1>
	<p>It is recommended you read <a href="https://github.com/kercre123/wire-pod/blob/main/README.md" target="_blank">README.md</a></p>
	<p>Once you have configured everything here, click the 'Setup wire-pod' button to start the installation. That button will also restart (or start) wire-pod automatically.</p>
	<p>If you are unsure what to do, just select the recommended options.</p>

			<h3>Speech-to-text service</h3>
			<p>Wire-pod currently supports two STT (speech-to-text) services. The recommended/default one is Coqui, because it is completely local while still being accurate and speedy on most systems. The other option is Picovoice Leopard, which is more accurate and faster than Coqui, and is local, but usage is recorded on a server. To use Picovoice, you will have to create an account at <a href="https://console.picovoice.ai">Picovoice</a> and enter your API key.</p>
			<select onchange="showPicovoiceForm()" name="sttSettings" id="sttSettings" form="sttSettings">

				<option value="picovoice_leopard">Picovoice Leopard</option>		
			</select><br>
			<div id="picovoiceAPIInput"></div>
			<h3>Hostname</h3>
			<p>If you are setting this up for a production bot, you must choose escapepod.local. If you are setting up for OSKR/dev-only, IP address is recommended.</p>
			<select name="hostnameSettings" id="hostnameSettings" form="hostnameSettings">

			<h3>Weather API</h3>
			<p>Would you like to setup weather commands? This involves creating a free account at <a href="https://weatherapi.com/" target="_blank">weatherapi.com</a> and putting in your API key. This is optional.</p>			
            <label for="weatherSettings">Do you want to setup weather API?:</label>

			<h3>Knowledge Graph</h3>
			<p>Would you like to setup Knowledge Graph ("I have a question")? This involves creating a free account at <a href="https://houndify.com/" target="_blank">houndify.com</a> and entering a Client Key and Client ID for one of your domains.<br /> Note: It may look like you only get a trial, but there is an actual free tier with 100 free requests per day.<br />This is optional.</p>
